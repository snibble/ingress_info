ingress_info
============

Ingress_info is a ruby gem for managing information about Niantic Labs' Ingress ARG. In present form, it answers questions about cycles and checkpoints for game scoring. Longer-term, cell scores would be awesome, if I can figure out where to get them. I'm not particularly interested in this growing to cover things like portal infomration, agent information, etc.

##Use

    gem install ingress_info

##Changelog

See [CHANGELOG][].
