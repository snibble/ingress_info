Ingress_info
============

Ingress_info is a ruby gem for managing information about Niantic Labs' Ingress ARG. In present form, it answers questions about cycles and checkpoints for game scoring. Longer-term, cell scores would be awesome, if I can figure out where to get them. I'm not particularly interested in this growing to cover things like portal infomration, agent information, etc.

##Use

Releases of ingress_info are provided as ruby gems at rubygem.org. Installation is as easy as:
```sh
    $ gem install ingress_info
```

##Changelog

See CHANGELOG.md.
